Adds several Modular Outfits for ships. The outfits allow increases to outfit, cargo, bunk, weapon, engine, hull, and shields respectively to an existing ship. Each one has high mass weights and heavy costs to provide some balance.

There is also an android included in this pack. It costs power and outfit space to provide some balance.

Currently they are only in pirate shops.
