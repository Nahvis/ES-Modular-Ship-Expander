# Modular-Ship-Expander
This is a plugin for the game Endless Sky that adds several Modular Outfits for ships. The outfits allow adding outfit, cargo, bunk, weapon, engine, hull, or shields respectively to an existing ship. Each one has high mass weights and heavy costs to provide some balance.

There is also an android included in this pack. It costs power and outfit space to provide some balance.

Currently they are only in pirate shops.

All current images are slightly edited versions from the default version of the game. Found at https://github.com/endless-sky
